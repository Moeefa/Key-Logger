# Key Logger ‚å®Ô∏èüêç
A simple python script that logs every key typed in your keyboard and sends to your Discord.  
It sends to your Discord every Enter key pressed and Backspace key actually deletes the string.  
You can use it as a template to improve the code.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
Stay aware that, it may be safer connect the client (victim) to a socket in the server, rather than expose your Discord token at the client side.

This script is for educational purposes only.
